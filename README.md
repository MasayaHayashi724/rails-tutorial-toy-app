# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## [toy_app](https://warm-shelf-93524.herokuapp.com/)

This is the second application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.jp/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

### Tips I lerned from this app

- Update Rails to 5.0.2 to avoid `key must be 32 bytes` error.
  - Don't use 5.0.0.1 like rails-tutorial.
- Commenting out the line including ruby command won't work. Just delete the line if it includes ruby command.
- Execute `sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3` to manually edit database.
